# DTD App

## Overview

**DTD App**, a fraternity application for both IOS and Android I started during a hackathon!


## Technologies Used 

**1.** Appcelerator Titanium

**2.** Alloy.js language


## Prerequisites

1. Have Appcelerator Titanium installed: [Free Download] (<http://www.appcelerator.com/titanium/download-titanium/>).

2. Get all the SDKs and dependencies installed. Titanium should help you out with that.


## Usage / Features

######DTD-App has the following features so far:

1.  Log-in for approved fraternity members.

2.  Ability to view menus for the week.


######Features to be added for the future:

1.  Sign up for duties.

2.  Alerts and news from chapter meetings.

3.  Calendar of fraternity events.
4. Shuttle schedule for MIT.


## Installation / Development

All development should be done on Titanium. Read the documentation [here](<http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/3.0/>). It has its own programming language but it's super similar to Javascript so learning this should make learning JS easier and vice-versa.


### Thanks

Thanks to Charlie Gordon and everybody who attended the hackathon I put together at the Delts house!
